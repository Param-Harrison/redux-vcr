# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing to ReduxVCR!

## Issues

If you encounter any problems, simply open an issue. Because this project is new (and in alpha), we expect lots of issues to be raised.

## Development

For development instructions, please see (the development docs)[https://github.com/joshwcomeau/redux-vcr/documentation/setting-up-development-environment.md].


### Testing

To run the tests, you can run any of the following commands from the root directory:

```bash
npm run test:capture
npm run test:persist
npm run test:retrieve
npm run test:replay
npm run test:shared

npm run test
```

That last command will run the whole suite of tests.

By `cd`ing into an individual package's repo, you can also run a test watcher:

```bash
npm run test:watch
```



### Linting

We use a slightly-modified version of AirBnb's ESLint rules.


### Docs

Improvements to the docs are greatly appreciated!
